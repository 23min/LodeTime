# LodeTime: Vision & Core Concept

> A Living Development Companion

---

## The Vision

LodeTime is a **development process runtime** - a BEAM-based "nervous system" that runs continuously alongside your development work. It's not a documentation tool, not a static analyzer, not a CI system. It's something that's **alive**, **observant**, and **participatory**.

### The One-Liner

> LodeTime is an always-running companion that knows your architecture, watches your code, validates your contracts, runs your tests intelligently, and talks to your AI tools.

### The Feeling We're Going For

> "LodeTime is always running in the background. When I save a file, it knows what component I'm working on, runs the relevant tests, checks if I'm violating any contracts, and tells me if something's wrong. When I use Claude Code, it gives Claude full context about my architecture - not just the code, but what's planned, what's deprecated, what contracts exist. It's like having a team member who's always watching the build, always knows the architecture, and is always available to answer 'what would break if I change this?'"

## What LodeTime Is

### A Development Process Runtime

| Traditional Tools | LodeTime |
|-------------------|----------|
| Run when you invoke them | Always running |
| Tell you about code | Tells you about architecture + process + state |
| Generate reports | Maintains live state |
| Reactive | Proactive |
| For humans | For humans AND AI |

### Architecture + Process + State

LodeTime tracks three things:

1. **Architecture**: Components, dependencies, contracts, boundaries
2. **Process**: What's being developed, what's blocked, what's next
3. **State**: Health, test results, validation status, recent activity

## What LodeTime Is NOT

| LodeTime is NOT | But it IS |
|-----------------|-----------|
| A documentation generator | A living knowledge base |
| A static analysis tool | A continuous validator |
| A visualization tool | A structured data provider |
| Code intelligence (Sourcegraph) | Architecture intelligence |
| An IDE plugin | A standalone companion |
| A CI/CD replacement | A CI/CD complement |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Architecture is Explicit** - Don't infer what you can declare
2. **Intent Matters** - Track not just what IS but what SHOULD BE
3. **Continuous Over Periodic** - Run continuously, not just in CI
4. **AI-First Data** - Structure data for AI consumption
5. **Resilient by Design** - Built on BEAM for resilience

## Who Is This For?

### Primary: Individual Developers
- Working on medium-to-large codebases
- Using AI coding assistants
- Wanting better architecture discipline

### Secondary: Small Teams
- Wanting shared architectural understanding
- Tired of architecture docs getting stale
