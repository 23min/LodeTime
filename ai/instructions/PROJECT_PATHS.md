# Project Paths & Overrides

Use this file to configure where roadmap and architecture artifacts live.
Skills should reference these paths instead of hardcoding locations.

## Required Paths

- **EPIC_ROADMAP_PATH:** `ROADMAP.md` (epic list + status; if unused, mark as N/A)
- **EPIC_TECH_ROADMAP_PATH:** `dev/architecture/epic-roadmap.md`

## Optional Paths

- **PHASE_ROADMAP_PATH:** `docs/phases/IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md`
- **ARCHITECTURE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH:** `.lodetime/`

## Notes

- Epics and phases are separate; phases may include multiple epics.
- Phase changes are manual and only updated when explicitly requested.
